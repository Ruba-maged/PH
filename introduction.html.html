        <p style="font-size: x-large;">
            We mean to create a medical website, that raises awareness of some unknown diseases. We aim to be a part of
            their healing process, as supporters and guiders. Our targeted users are:
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•People with disabilities/ diseases/ rare syndromes.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•Medical experts/ scientists/ doctors.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•Donators.</ul>

        <h1>Why was PH created?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">
            There are a lot of brutal unacknowledged diseases, people who suffer from those diseases may find it
            difficult
            to cope with, these diseases may include:
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Ochoa syndrome</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Foreign accent syndrome</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Carcinoid syndrome</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Situs inversus</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Wilson’s disease</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Stiff person syndrome</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Laughing Death ( Kuru ).</ul>
       <p style="font-size: x-large;"> And many more.<br><br>
        Many countries may not have the qualified doctors or facilities to help those in need of a treatment. We try as
        much as possible to help them, by providing the required finances based off donations, and organizing meetings
        with
        expert doctors
        </p>

        <h1>How we can help:</h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">
            We’re aiming to create a website that helps them cope in various ways;
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•<strong>Group therapy:</strong> people with the same conditions and symptoms
            can help each other face whatever they are going through.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•<strong>Motivation:</strong> we connect those who still suffer from a disease
            to cured ones , so they can be a source of inspiration to them.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">•<strong>Experts’ advice:</strong> Some diseases and disabilities are hard to
            cure and it’s not always that a specialist is available, we try to provide that.</ul>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">
            Not only that, but we will provide side options as well, that could play small roles in healing those
            people;
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>•Medical tests:</strong> Tests designed by experts to help people
            determine whether they have a certain syndrome or disease or not, according to their symptoms and medical
            tests.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Collecting donations.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Detecting nearby hospitals that require organ donations.</ul>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">• Provided medical reports: Reports that describe certain diseases and their
            symptoms to help patients learn more about them.</ul>
